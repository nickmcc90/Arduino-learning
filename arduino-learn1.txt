--PART 1: WHAT CAN AN ARDUINO DO--

It's a tool that helps you control electronic stuff with code. If you are going to
build a project with electronic stuff, you are going to need an arduino.

Electronic stuff is stuff like inputs and outputs.

Inputs: Temperature, light, touch, flex, distance sensors.
Outputs: DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, led strips, buzzers, speakers.

Arduino stands in between these things and has logic in code that controls these things.

The Arduino Trifecta
1. Hardware
2. IDE
3. Code

Hardware
All arduino have a microcontroller on them. This allows us to read inputs and control outputs.

IDE
This is just the arduino software space for the code to be written on, that the arduino will read.

Code
Arduino code is called a sketch. The coding is basically like C and C++ with its own syntax
as well.
