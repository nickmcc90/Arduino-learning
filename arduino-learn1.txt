--PART 1: WHAT CAN AN ARDUINO DO--

It's a tool that helps you control electronic stuff with code. If you are going to
build a project with electronic stuff, you are going to need an arduino.

Electronic stuff is stuff like inputs and outputs.

Inputs: Temperature, light, touch, flex, distance sensors.
Outputs: DC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, led strips, buzzers, speakers.

Arduino stands in between these things and has logic in code that controls these things.

The Arduino Trifecta
1. Hardware
2. IDE
3. Code

Hardware
All arduino have a microcontroller on them. This allows us to read inputs and control outputs.

IDE
This is just the arduino software space for the code to be written on, that the arduino will read.

Code
Arduino code is called a sketch. The coding is basically like C and C++ with its own syntax
as well.

--PART 2: WHAT ARDUINO STUFF SHOULD I BUY?--
<timestamp: 5:33>

If I need electronic parts, I can look on Octopart.

This guy recommends buying an Arduino UNO Rev 3. It's really popular so
there are a lot of tutorials with it, and it has 20 different input ports.

There are a lot of different boards that look like arduino boards because
when arduino made their IDE, board, and code, it was all open source. So people
were allowed to make the exact same things and sell them themselves.

"Arduino compatible" means the board will work with the Arduino IDE.
